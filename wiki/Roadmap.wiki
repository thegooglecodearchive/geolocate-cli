#summary geolocate-cli release roadmap.

= Roadmap =

The very rough plan for the project follows.  Specific issues needed to reach each version are in the bug tracker http://code.google.com/p/geolocate-cli/issues/list?sort=milestone :


== Version 0.1 ==

A rough and ready but usuable release.  Needs to have licence info and some docs.  The crude overall structure of the modules and ui should be in place.


== Version 0.2 ==

Refinements of the modular structure and ui from 0.1 as necessary.  Extra features include a config file / dir and some of the more complex plguins


== Version 0.3 ==

The major change for 0.3 will be the addition of a geocoding module.  This should be relatively simple given the architectural work completed in 0.2
